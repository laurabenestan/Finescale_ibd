# 0. Introduction

This github page is to present the statistical analyses presenetd in the paper entitled "Restricted dispersal in a sea of gene flow".
The paper is currently submitted as part of the project [Reservebenfit](https://www.biodiversa.org/1023) that aim to evaluate and manage connectivity in a network of Marine Protected Areas to maintain genetic diversity and deliver fish beyond protected limits.

# 1. Sampling

Sampling scheme is individual-based, as opposed to the population-level analyses that are typically conducted at large spatial scales.
We adopt this individual‐based sampling scheme to efficiency detect isolation‐by‐distance as indicated by a *in silico* analysis.
